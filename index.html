                    Hi! My name is Yanjun Chen. I am currently a first-year graduate student at the University of Michigan School of Information, 
                    where I am working towards a Master of Science in Information with a focus on Data Science and Analytics. 
                    I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in August 2021 with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
                    I love travelling and trying out food from different cultures. In this blog, I will introduce to you my story with worldwide food cultures.
                </p>

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Shanghai, China. As you may know, China has a vast territory. 
                    In the past five years, I've been to different cities in China with my friends.
                    In 2019, I went to Europe and travelled to cities all around Spain and Portugal.
                    I spent 3 months in England as an exchange student at the University of Warwick in 2020.
                    Last year, I came to the US as a graduate student at UMSI.
                    Being exposed to different cultures, I've been lucky enough to use my camera to document the foods I've tried all over the world.
